Welcome to the VMware IT Support Lab! This repository contains all the necessary steps, configurations, and scripts to set up a comprehensive virtualized environment where you can practice and enhance your Tier 1 IT Support skills. The project leverages VMware Workstation or VMware Fusion to create virtual machines (VMs) running Windows Server and Linux distributions, providing a practical platform for IT support professionals to learn and grow.

# Project Overview
This lab aims to simulate real-world Tier 1 IT Support tasks. You'll set up and manage virtualized machines, configure Active Directory, enable remote desktop access, implement BitLocker encryption, troubleshoot system errors, and even simulate an IT ticketing system. This project offers an excellent opportunity to practice core IT skills in a safe and controlled environment.
